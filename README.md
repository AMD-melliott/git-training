# Git & GitHub Workshop for Non-Coders

Welcome to the **Git and GitHub for Non-Coders** workshop series! This hands-on training teaches you the fundamental skills for collaborating on documentation using Git, GitHub, and VS Code.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop uses a **docs-as-code** approach, treating documentation like source code. You'll learn the same workflows used by software development teams, but applied to writing and managing documentation in Markdown and reStructuredText.

**By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:**
- ✅ Fork, clone, and contribute to GitHub repositories
- ✅ Create branches and pull requests
- ✅ Use VS Code's Git integration and visual diff tools
- ✅ Resolve merge conflicts with confidence
- ✅ Write and preview Markdown documentation
- ✅ Perform project-wide search and replace operations
